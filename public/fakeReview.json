They were in pre packed bags, bought it home to find out most of it is rotton! Why are you selling produce that's been packed by your staff knowing full well that's the produce is bad. Stop being so greedy and fooling the People that have made you successful. Absolutely disgusted."

The staff working at the till are so rude, no manners, they speak to customers as if customers are begging vegetables of them. My advice to management is send your staff to customer service course so at least they can train them so basic customer service. We as customer are here to buy things from you. We are not beggers."
